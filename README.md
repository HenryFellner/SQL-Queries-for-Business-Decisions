# SQL-Queries-for-Business-Decisions
This project was made to use relatively complex SQL commands and joins to answer hypothetical business questions a store might have.

The main file is titled "Using+Sql+For...". This is the main project. It uses complex SQL joins to answer business questions using a database from a hypothetical store.

However to show basic competency in SQL, another smaller project is given that uses CIA data on the world's countries.
